>  1. As an important class of machine learning methods, **RL aims to solve uncertain decision-making problems by interacting with the environment and near-optimal or suboptimal policies can be obtained in a data-driven way** [24].
>  2. Reinforcement learning techniques [24] address the problem of how an agent can learn to approximate an optimal or near-optimal behavioral strategy while interacting with its environment.
