In combinatorics, **Bertrand's ballot problem** is the question: "In an election where candidate A receives *p* votes and candidate B receives *q* votes with *p* > *q*, what is the probability that A will be strictly ahead of B throughout the count?"

the answer is $$\frac{p-q}{p+q}$$

和《应用随机过程——概率模型导论》中1-24题是一样的
